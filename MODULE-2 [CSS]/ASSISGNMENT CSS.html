  <h3>QUESTION-1 <br>
    What are the benefits of using CSS?</h3>
  <P>There are a number of benefits of CSS, including: <br>

    1) Faster Page Speed
    More code means slower page speed. And CSS enables you to use less code. CSS allows you to use one CSS rule and apply it to all occurrences of a certain tag within an HTML document.<br> <br>
    
    2) Better User Experience
    CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also allows for user-friendly formatting. When buttons and text are in logical places and well organized, user experience improves.<br> <br>
    
    3) Quicker Development Time
    With CSS, you can apply specific formatting rules and styles to multiple pages with one string of code. One cascading style sheet can be replicated across several website pages. If, for instance, you have product pages that should all have the same formatting, look, and feel, writing CSS rules for one page will suffice for all pages of that same type.<br> <br>
    
    4) Easy Formatting Changes
    If you need to change the format of a specific set of pages, it’s easy to do so with CSS. There’s no need to fix every individual page. Just edit the corresponding CSS stylesheet and you’ll see changes applied to all the pages that are using that style sheet.<br> <br>
    
    5) Compatibility Across Devices
    Responsive web design matters. In today’s day and age, web pages must be fully visible and easily navigable on all devices. Whether mobile or tablet, desktop, or even smart TV, CSS combines with HTML to make responsive design possible.<br> <br>
  
    <h1 >For Example :- <span style="background-color: blueviolet;"> backround colour </span></h1>
     <h1 style="color: brown;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  font colour </h1> <hr>

  <h3>QUESTION-2 <br>
    What are the disadvantages of CSS? </h3>
<p>1--> Cross-Browser Issues <br>
  Implementing initial CSS changes on a website is accessible on the developer’s end. However, you will have to confirm the compatibility if the CSS displays similar change effects on all the browsers. <br> It is simple since CSS works differently on different browsers. <br> <br>
  
  2--> Confusion Due to Its Many Levels <br>
  The  programming language world is indeed complicated for non-developers and beginners. <br> Moreover, different levels of CSS <br> f.e. CSS; CSS 2; CSS 3 can be pretty confusing for most of the users. <br> <br>
  
  3--> Be Ready to Fix HTML Tags <br>
  In practice, it is often necessary to fix not only one CSS file but also HTML tags associated with CSS selectors. <br> It sometimes significantly increases the editing time and testing as <br><br>
  
 4--> Different Layout Display <br>
  If browsers are outdated, the same CSS data may be interpreted differently by them.</p><br>

  <!-- QUESTION-3 -->
  <h3>QUESTION-3 <br> What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</h3>
  <p> The biggest difference between CSS2 and CSS3 is that CSS3 is now split into different modules. <br> Since each module makes its way through the W3C individually, there’s a wider range of browser support. <br> Make sure you test your CSS3 pages in as many browsers and operating systems as possible to ensure compatibility. <br>

  <!-- QUESTION - 4 -->
  <h3>QUESTION-4 <br>Name a few CSS style components </h3>
  <p>
   * Some of the commonly used modules in the current version of CSS include:* <br> <br>
    
   &nbsp; 1. Box Model  <br>
   &nbsp; 2. Selectors <br>
   &nbsp; 3. Text effects <br>
   &nbsp; 4. Backgrounds and Borders <br>
   &nbsp; 5. Animati ons <br>
   &nbsp; 6. 2D/3D Transformations <br>
   &nbsp; 7. User Interface. <br>
   &nbsp; 8. Multiple Column Layout <br></p> <hr> <hr>


<!--QUESTION-5  -->
<h3>QUESTION-5 <br>What do you understand by CSS opacity?</h3>
<p >The opacity in CSS is the property of an element that describes the transparency of the element. <br> It is the opposite of transparency & represents the degree to which the content will be hidden behind an element. <br>

  We can apply the opacity with different styling properties to the elements. A few of them are discussed below: <br>
  
  Image Opacity: The opacity property is used in the image to describe the transparency of the image. <br> The value of opacity lies between 0.0 to 1.0 where a low value represents high transparency and a high value represents low transparency. <br> The percentage of opacity is calculated as Opacity% = Opacity * 100. <br>
  <p>For Example :-</p>
<div style="height: 150px; width: 100px; background: #000; color: rgb(255, 166, 0);opacity: 0.5; display: flex; align-items: center; padding-left: 30px; ">OPACITY </div>
</p> <hr> <hr> 

<!-- QUESTION-6 -->
<h3>QUESTION-6 <br> How can the background color of an element be changed?</h3>
<p> <span style="background: linear-gradient(); color: darkslategray;"> The background-color property sets the background color of an element.</span> <br>

  The background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin). <br>
  
  Tip: Use a background color and a text color that makes the text easy to read.
  <br><br>
  FOR EXAMPLE :-- <br><br>
  <div style="height: 150px; width: 100; background: linear-gradient(60deg,#393d50,#000000,#79c900, #f56357); color: rgb(126, 175, 253); display: flex; align-items: center; padding-left: 30px; font-size: 50px; ">Backgrounds</div> <br> <br>
  <div style="height: 150px; width: 100; background: linear-gradient(60deg,#000000,#edb5bd, #9c9cdd,#bedfd4); color: rgb(255, 255, 255); display: flex; align-items: center; padding-left: 30px; font-size: 50px; ">Backgrounds</div>

  <!-- QUESTION-7 -->
  <h3>QUESTION-7 <br>How can image repetition of the backup be controlled? </h3>
<p style="background-repeat: no-repeat;">
  <i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>
  In this article, we will see how an image repetition of the backup is controlled in CSS. <br> <br>  <i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i> This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the repetition of the image. <br><br>  <i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i> The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically. <br> <br>
  <mark style="background-color: #000000; color: white;"> Property:-"background-repeat: no-repeat;" </mark> 
  <hr><hr>

  <!-- QUESTION-8 -->
  <h3>QUESTION-8 <br> What is the use of the background-position property?</h3>
  <p><i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> The background-position CSS property sets the initial position for each background image. <br><i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> The position is relative to the position layer set by background-origin. <br>
<br>
<i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> A position defines an x/y coordinate, to place an item relative to the edges of an element's box. <br> <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> It can be defined using one to four values. If two non-keyword values are used, the first value represents the horizontal position and the second represents the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vertical position. <br><i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> If only one value is specified, the second value is assumed to be center. <br> <br>
<i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> The keyword value center, which centers the image. <br>
<i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> One of the keyword values top, left, bottom, right. <br> <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> This specifies an edge against which to place the item. The other dimension is then set to 50%, so the item is placed in the middle of the edge specified. <br><br>
    </p>
    <h1> &nbsp;&nbsp; EXAMPLE :-</h1>
    <div style="height: 200px;width: 150px; background-color: #f56357; color: #000;background-position: center ; margin: auto;padding: 12px; ">POSITION-CENTER</div> <hr><hr>

<!-- QUESTION-9 -->
<H3>QUESTION-9 <br>Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</H3>
<p><i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> A background-image that will not scroll with the page (fixed): <br> 

  <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>  scroll	The background image will scroll with the page. This is default. <br>
  <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>  fixed	The background image will not scroll with the page. <br></p>
  <h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i> background-attachment: scroll; <i class="fa fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> <br> property controls the image scroll in the background </h1> <hr><hr>

  <!-- QUESTION-10 -->
  <H3>QUESTION-10 <br>Why should background and color be used as separate properties</H3>
  <p> This is done with mainly two purpose: <br><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    1. Its makes the stylesheet more ligible. Background property,which is complex in itself , becomes all the more complex with color. <br>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Color is an inbuilt property While the background is not one. And this can lead a lot of Confusion.

<!-- QUESTION-11 -->
<h3>QUESTION-11 <br> How to center block elements using CSS1? </h3>
<p>1. Define the external width – We need to define the external width. <br> Block-level elements have the default width of 100% of the webpage, so for centering the block element, we need space around it. <br> So for generating the space, we are giving it a width. <br> <br> 
  
 2. Set the left-margin and the right-margin of the element to auto – Since we produced a remaining space by providing external width so now we need to align that space properly that’s why we should use margin property. <br> Margin is a property that tells how to align a remaining space. <br> So for centering the element you must set left-margin to auto and right-margin to auto. <br>

<h3>QUESTION-13 <br>hat are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page? </h3>
<p><i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"> </i>
   CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. <br><br>
  <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline CSS in a style attribute. <br><br>
  <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> 
   By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal stylesheet. <br><br>
  <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>  
   We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML. </p>

   <h3>QUESTION-14 <br></h3>
   <p><i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> CSS stylesheets are used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. <br><i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> It provides color, layout, background, font, and border properties while also allowing better content accessibility, enhanced flexibility, and control, as well as the specification of the characteristics of presentation. <br><i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>  CSS stylesheets can be applied to an HTML document in 3 ways – inline styles, embedded stylesheet, and external stylesheet. <br><br>

    <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Embedded Stylesheet: It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place. <br><i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>  This is done by embedding the <style></style> tags containing the CSS properties in the head of your document. <br><i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Embedded style sheets are particularly useful for HTML documents that have unique style requirements from the rest of the documents in your project. However, if the styles need to be applied across multiple documents, you should link to an external style sheet instead of using individual embedded style sheets. <br><i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Using embedded stylesheets holds a distinct advantage over inline styles which only allow you to address one HTML element at a time. <br> </p>

       <p>
        1.  The external style sheet is generally used when you want to make changes on multiple pages. <br><br> 2.  It is ideal for this condition because it facilitates you to change the look of the entire web site by changing just one file. <br><br> 
        3.  It uses the <link> tag on every pages and the <link> tag should be put inside the head section. <br><br></p>

        <h3>QUESTION-17 <br> What is the meaning of the CSS selector? </h3>
        <p> <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
           A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. <br><br>
           <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
           It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be  selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them. The element or elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the subject of the selector. <br><br>
           <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
           In other articles you may have met some different selectors, and learned that there are selectors that target the document in different ways — <br><br>
