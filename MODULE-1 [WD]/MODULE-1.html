  <h3>QUESTION-1</h3>
  <p>HTML Elements are components that are used in HTML Page.
    HTML Tags usually exist in pairs consisting of a starting and an ending tag. However, some tags do not have a closing tag.
    HTML Elements contain a starting tag, content, and an ending tag. If there is no content in an HTML Element, it is called an Empty HTML Element.
    HTML Elements can be nested. There can be an HTML element with another HTML Element as its content.
    HTML Tags are building blocks of HTML Page.
    </p> <hr>

    <h3>QUESTION-2</h3>
    <P> HTML tags are what defines where an HTML element starts and where it ends. There is usually an opening bracket followed by the element’s name and, finally, a closing bracket.

      In most cases, there is always a start tag and an end tag enclosing an element. Nevertheless, that is not the case for all elements.
      
      As far as HTML is concerned, there are several types of a tag. The first one is the start tag. It contains two opposite angle brackets. Examples include:
      
      < title >
      < p >
      < b >
      The other one is the end tag. The similarity to the start tag, it has angle brackets. However, there is a forward slash after the first angle bracket. Examples of the end tags corresponding to the start tags above are as follows.
      
      < /title >
      < /p >
      < /b >
      
      In simple words, an HTML attribute is what modifies an HTML element. It is usually in the form of unique words that one inserts inside the opening tag. They control the behavior of the element that follows.
      
      Every tag has two sections. The first one is usually the name of the attribute, while the other one is its value. The two are usually separated by an equals sign (=). Attributes are inside the start tag of that particular element that needs modification.
      
      < element attribute="value">element content</ element> </P>

        <h3>QUESTION-4</h3>
        <p>
          An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). You can also use them in place of other characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard. <br>

Character	Entity	Note <br>
&	      & amp ;	   Interpreted as the beginning of an entity or character reference. <br>
<	      & lt ;	     Interpreted as the beginning of a tag <br>
>	      & gt ;	     Interpreted as the ending of a tag <br>
"	      & quot ;	Interpreted as the beginning and end of an attribute's value. <br>

        <P>

  Cellspacing --> One can create it using the tag of HTML < table>, but it sets the type attribute to cellspacing. <br>
  
  Cellpadding --> It deals with a single cell. <br>
  
  Cellspacing --> It gets subjected to multiple cells (more than one) at a time. <br>
  
  Cellpadding --> The default value for cellpadding is 1. <br>
  
  Cellspacing --> The default value for cellspacing is 2. <br>
  
  Cellpadding --> It is very effective as compared to cellspacing. Thus, it is very widely used. <br>

<h3>QUESTION-10</h3>
<p>You can merge two or more table cells in a column using the colspan attribute in a <td> HTML tag (table data). To merge two or more row cells, use the rowspan attribute. <br> 

  How to use colspan attribute : <br>
  
    If we wanted to combine the first two cells in the first column, we could use the colspan="2" attribute in the first < td > tag. The number represents how many cells to use (merge) for the < td > tag, the first cell spans the width of two columns. <br>
  
  How to use rowspan attribute : <br>
  
    If we wanted to combine the first two cells in the first column into one cell, we could use the rowspan="2" attribute in the first < td > tag. The number represents how many cells to use for the < td > tag, the first cell spans the height of two rows. <br>
  
  Using "0" as the number in colspan and rowspan : <br>
  
    All modern browsers treat a "0" (zero) in the colspan and rowspan as the maximum rows or columns. For example, instead of counting a table's rows, use rowspan="0" to expand the row to the end of the table.Using "0" is helpful for big tables and for dynamic tables where the number of rows and columns may change frequently. <br>
